🎨 Design Philosophy
The design follows a "Storytelling first" approach. The dark background mimics a cinema or darkroom environment, ensuring the photographs are the brightest and most prominent elements on the page. Typography pairs Playfair Display (classic, editorial) with Manrope (modern, clean) to balance tradition with modernity.
